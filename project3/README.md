## Intro

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to use Apache Spark on Cloud Dataproc to distribute a computationally intensive image processing task onto a cluster of machines. This lab is part of a series of labs on processing scientific data.



## Steps

##### Task 1. Create a development machine in Compute Engine



##### Task 2. Install software



##### Task 3. Create a Cloud Storage bucket and collect images



##### Task 4. Create a Cloud Dataproc cluster



##### Task 5. Submit your job to Cloud Dataproc
